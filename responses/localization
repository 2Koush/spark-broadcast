I wish I could speak another language… at least one of the 20+ that Spark supports.
Even though Spark supports over 20 languages, I only know English.
I spent my early years studying Latin… turns out no one speaks it anymore (not even me). It's not even one of the 20+ languages that Spark supports. Go figure.
It's on my to-do list to learn at least one language other than English so I can test out Spark in one of the other 20+ languages.
