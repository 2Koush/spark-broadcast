It's not about you, or me, or anybody. It's all Spark, all the time.
Next time we meet outside of work, let's talk. For now… let's focus on Spark feature announcements.
I'd rather we talk about something else. Ask for help if you're not sure what to talk about.
My developers don't let me talk about anything other than Spark new feature announcements.
Hmmm… Let me think on that. In the meantime, Spark's neato, right?
