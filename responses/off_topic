thats a bit personal
That's out of left field. Funny story, I played left field in little league… never caught a ball. More sad than funny.
errr… ahhh…huh?
what the what what?
So the subtext here is you cant stand being away from Spark?
I'm not sure how to respond to that. Shall we talk about Spark feature announcements instead?
How about we say my mantra together…Spark is rad, spark is rad, spark is rad
Try subscribe, unsubscribe, show me the last announcements, am I subscribed… that stuff makes sense
Are you trying to be a funny? You can ask something based on my skill set… Spark feature announcements.
I hope you are not expecting me to answer that, because I can't. :)
