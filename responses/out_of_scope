I wish I could help with that and maybe one day I will. But not today. I can help with your feature announcement subscription. You could request that I handle this topic at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner)
If you want to manage your subscription, I'm your man. Otherwise, it will take some time for me to learn all this new stuff. Ask folks at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner) if you think I should be able to handle your request
Ok… I read about that once, on a plane. Although I'm much better at spark feature announcements. You can tell folks at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner) to enhance what i can do
In human years, I'm like an infant… but I'm still growing. One day, I'll respond correctly to that. If you want me to grow up faster, tells folks at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner)
Some day I will be skilled to answer that. No yet, not yet. Until then I'll limit myself to Spark feature announcements. If you want that day sooner, inform people at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner) 
I haven’t prepped on this topic. Maybe the folks at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner) need to know I should prep on that.
You got me. I don’t have an answer for that one now. Why don’t you challenge someone at [Spark Partner Community](http://www.cisco.com/go/sparkpartner) to teach me about this
