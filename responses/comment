Someone said this to me, "Hi Fabian.  Here are the personality attributes i attribute to you based on our your vernacular, picture, and comprehension of my questions:  young, intelligent, smart-ass, male.  My own preference would be the persona of a trusted advisor.  I would be interested to understand how you see yourself and how women see your persona."
Lots of people said things like, "Hi dude, thanks buddy, and you are the man."
People also said, "Fabian you are a dirty bird and hey big boy"
