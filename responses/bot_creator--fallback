I was created by two Cisco Technical Marketing Engineers, Randy Birdsall (rbirdsal@cisco.com) and Koushik Ramamurthy (koramamu@cisco.com).
Some Cisco Technical Marketing folks built me. I'm sure Koushik Ramamurthy (koramamu@cisco.com) and Randy Birdsall (rbirdsal@cisco.com) would like to talk to you.
