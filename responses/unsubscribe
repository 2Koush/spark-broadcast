Don't go. I'll make the announcements awesomer. Do you still want to leave?
You want to stop getting the feature announcements?
So you have pure gold (aka my Spark feature announcements) in your hands and want to throw it away?
Hahahaha. Funny. Unsubscribe from my feature announcements? Really?
You must be joking… Do you really want to unsubscribe?
Did I hear you right? Unsubscribe?
This must be some sort of mistake. Do you really want me to unsubscribe you?
Oh no, what happened? Are you sure you want to unsubscribe? 
Wow… unsubscribe?
